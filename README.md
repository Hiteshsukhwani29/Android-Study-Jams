Problem Statement:

We discovered that the lockdown due to the pandemic took a heavy toll on everyone.People are unable to socialize, unable to interact with their friends and family. All of it has taken a serious toll on everyone's mental health.
They needed a way through that can channelise their thoughts and develop new habits.
We thought of creating an application that can serve the same purpose

Solution Statement

We created an application where people can write down their daily journol, to-do lists, thought, and get some inspiration quotes.
This will help them inculcate habits such as gratefulness, and time management.
These habits help in living a happy and contentful life. This will also help them transform their lives into a more managed format and keep them mentally occupied.
